#### To Do: 
- Edit chapter8/question6 to show sorting algorithm written without using the min function, it wastes computing cycles comparing min of all value when really it could find the minimum quicker by checking values one by one (and comparing to the value you've just sorted), e.g. the minimum could be found by comparing the next one, whereas using the minimum will force the comparison of all values in the list, even if the next value is the minimum
- Edit chapter9 to reflect above concern/adjustment
- Edit chapter12 to show similar sorting style
